Working with PL/SQL Libraries and program units in oracle forms
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program Units:
-----------------

Program Units in Oracle Forms are containers for storing PL/SQL code that is specific to a particular form or report.
They are associated with a specific form or report and are often used to define event triggers, procedures, functions, and other PL/SQL code that is unique to that particular module.
Program Units are typically used for implementing business logic and behavior specific to a particular form or report.
The PL/SQL code within a Program Unit is tightly coupled with the form or report it belongs to and is not easily reusable in other modules.

PL/SQL Libraries:
----------------------

PL/SQL Libraries, on the other hand, are reusable units of PL/SQL code that can be shared across multiple forms and reports within an Oracle Forms application.
They are created separately from forms and reports and can be associated with multiple modules.
PL/SQL Libraries are typically used for storing common business logic, utility functions, and other code that can be shared across different forms and reports.
Code within a PL/SQL Library is encapsulated, making it easier to maintain and update. Changes made to the library are automatically reflected in all modules that use it.

In summary, Program Units are specific to a single form or report and are used to encapsulate code that is unique to that module, while PL/SQL Libraries are reusable across multiple modules and are used for storing common code that can be shared. PL/SQL Libraries promote code reuse and maintainability, making them a more efficient choice when you have common functionality that needs to be shared across different parts of your Oracle Forms application.

once the plsql libraries are created we are attached with the libraries using Attach Libraries options.
